## Data summary

The data is published [here](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/delayed-transfers-of-care/delayed-transfers-of-care-data-2019-20/). There are three different types of data:

* Time series for England. This does not look very useful since it is very high level
* Total Delayed Days Local Authority. High level summary of delays by local authority
* Total Delayed Days Trust. High level summary of delays by health Trust
* CSV Format Monthly Delayed Transfers of Care. Granular data given by 

### Total delayed days by local authority

There are several sheets here. I've read sheet 4 for now which gives the reason for the DTOC.

### Total delayed days by Trust



## Shiny application

Toolkit is [here](https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/delayed-transfer-care-dtoc-improvement-tool/). It contains:

* Pareto graph of reason for discharge
* SPC of DTOCs (all reason)
* And then SPC by reason
